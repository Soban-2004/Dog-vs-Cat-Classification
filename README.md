# Cat vs Dog Classification using Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

This project aims to classify images of cats and dogs using machine learning, specifically using a Support Vector Classifier (SVC). The dataset used in this project is the Kaggle Cats vs Dogs dataset.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build an image classification model that can distinguish between images of cats and dogs. A Support Vector Classifier (SVC) is used as the machine learning model to train on the image features and predict the class (cat or dog) for a given input image.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Kaggle Cats vs Dogs Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data), which contains labeled images of cats and dogs. Each image is labeled as either 'cat' or 'dog' and is used to train the classification model.
